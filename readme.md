# The Joke Prospector
Welcome to the Joke Prospector, the javaScript-based application that is designed to help you make funnier one-liners! Unfortunately, I cannot take credit for such a grand idea, which is based on the work of Greg Dean who developed the Joke Prospecting method.

You can find Greg Dean's work on amazing: [Step-Stand-Up-Comedy-Greg-Dean](http://www.amazon.com/Step-Stand-Up-Comedy-Greg-Dean/dp/0325001790/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452346597&sr=8-1&keywords=greg+dean).

His course is also available on Udemy: [Be Funny: Writing Comedy for Business](https://www.udemy.com/writing-comedy-for-business/learn/).
